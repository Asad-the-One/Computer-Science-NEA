# Computer Science NEA Project

As part of A-Level Computer Science, we are required to create a program/application. I have decided to do a game where you explore a maze.

## Description


## Target audience


## Inspiration


## Algorithm descriptions

- *Auto generating new maps every game.*

- *Pathfinding algorithm for NPCs. React to sound and scent, but otherwise randomly roam the map.*

- Random generation of items in crates, and locations around the map.

- Tracking NPC movement and giving the user an idea of where they are via text outputs such as “You hear a rustle coming from ahead” and “The stench of something rotting bothers you”.

- General interactions. Moving around the map; checking your surroundings for dropped items and crates.

- Rendering a map for the user so they can track their location as they move. I.e. a minimap.

- Login system for leaderboard access (optional).

- Sync with a leaderboard in the cloud. Uses a hashing algorithm on the Python file to make a string and sends it to the cloud along with score and time so cheaters cannot modify the script.

## Demonstrated skills

- OOP

- File handling

- Server communication

- GUI design
