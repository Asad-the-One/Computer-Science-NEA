# Computer Science NEA Project

As part of A-Level Computer Science, we are required to create a program/application that solves a problem. I have decided on an all-in-one student toolkit.

## Features

- Flashcard system.
 - Create and edit flashcards for quick revision.

- Testing
 - Multiple choice/Written questions that can be compared against a mark scheme.

- Grade tracker
 - Track test scores and grades, and predict what grade you will get given your current performance.

- Expense tracker
 - Simple budget management system. Projects future expenses.

- Study schedule
 - Create your own, or have the program create one given performance in subjects.

- Todo list

- Exam countdown

Perhaps will introduce gamification in knowledge tests. May introduce more features.
